# CPSC483Final

How to run:

Install libraries from requirements.txt.

Download Python Notebook and CSV and run script. Note that due to HIPAA constraints I cannot share the data regarding the patients, so I have provided a toy dataset to run the script on. I have not cleared my output from the actual run to show what the results would look like if I was able to share the data.
