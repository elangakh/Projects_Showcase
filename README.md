##  Academic Projects

### CPSC 483 – Leveraging GNNs to Improve AI-ECG Disease Detection for LVSD
- Developed a **Graph Neural Network (GNN)** framework to enhance AI-ECG–based prediction of **Left Ventricular Systolic Dysfunction (LVSD)**.  
- Modeled each patient’s ECGs as graph nodes connected by temporal and demographic relationships to improve classification robustness and interpretability.  
- Focused on scalability, noise resistance, and real-world clinical data integration.

### CPSC 486 – A Mathematical Analysis of Diffusion Processes and GANs for Image Generation
- Conducted a **theoretical study** of diffusion-based generative models and **GAN dynamics** using probability and stochastic analysis.  
- Implemented and trained diffusion models in **PyTorch** to empirically validate mathematical findings.  
- Compared convergence behavior, noise schedules, and sample quality between diffusion and adversarial frameworks.

### SDS 230 – Statistical Analysis of Video Game Sales and Ratings (1980–2020)
- Conducted an extensive statistical analysis of global video game sales and rating data spanning four decades (1980–2020).  
- Utilized a Kaggle dataset containing over 6,900 entries, performing data cleaning, variable recoding, and transformation for use in inferential models.  
- Applied statistical techniques including **t-tests**, **ANOVA**, **ANCOVA**, and **multiple regression** to identify key predictors of sales performance across markets and platforms.  
- Explored relationships between **critic and user ratings**, **genre**, and **console type**, constructing a final generalized linear model to predict global sales outcomes.  
- Implemented all analyses and visualizations in **R**, leveraging libraries such as `GGally`, `car`, and `stats` for correlation analysis, bootstrapping, and stepwise model selection.
