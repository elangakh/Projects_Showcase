##  Academic Projects

### CPSC 483 – Leveraging GNNs to Improve AI-ECG Disease Detection for LVSD
- Developed a **Graph Neural Network (GNN)** framework to enhance AI-ECG–based prediction of **Left Ventricular Systolic Dysfunction (LVSD)**.  
- Modeled each patient’s ECGs as graph nodes connected by temporal and demographic relationships to improve classification robustness and interpretability.  
- Focused on scalability, noise resistance, and real-world clinical data integration.

### CPSC 486 – A Mathematical Analysis of Diffusion Processes and GANs for Image Generation
- Conducted a **theoretical study** of diffusion-based generative models and **GAN dynamics** using probability and stochastic analysis.  
- Implemented and trained diffusion models in **PyTorch** to empirically validate mathematical findings.  
- Compared convergence behavior, noise schedules, and sample quality between diffusion and adversarial frameworks.
